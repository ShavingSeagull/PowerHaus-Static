                <p>The name, obviously.</p>
                <p>
                    ...other than that, though, it's our passion for all things fitness that we believe gives us the edge over our
                    competition. It's not just the spirit of the company that bleeds a love of fitness, it's also within our staff.
                    When you buy from the PowerHaus, you can trust that you're putting the very best into your body, so that you 
                    get the very best out of it, too.

                            Ouch. That one hurt. The truth is that, no, we're actually not. Besides what we offer fitness enthusiasts on this 
                            site, we also work closely with a lot of gyms, community centers and sporting events. Why? Because we believe in 
                            getting people moving; we believe in encouraging people to push themselves and their limits.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our work has led to sponsorships at some of the best bodybuilding tournaments in the world, as well as the personal
                            sponsorship of some of the talented folks who provide the face of the fitness industry today. Our mantra has always
                            been about making you the best version of yourself you can be, and that goes above and beyond just a simple
                            supplement store.

                <h3>What are our goals for the future?</h3>
                <p>
                    The most dreaded interview question of all time. For us, though, it's an easy one because we have big plans ahead
                    and we just love to talk about them. Primarily, we'd like to expand the commercial side of the business to achieve
                    a greater global reach. We believe we have the quality of products to back that ambition up, as many of our regular
                    customers have attested over the last few years. Aside from that, we have plans to open a physical store in the heart
                    of London, with the hope of expanding to other major cities around the world. A lot of people talk about the death
                    of the high street these days, but we know the value in the unique and unbeatable experience of actually holding
                    what you're interested in purchasing in your own hands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from the commercial aspect, PowerHaus has the ability to help shape the future of the fitness world for years to come. 
                    We don't want to stop at just a gym presence. We believe, especially in the current climate, that we have an obligation to do 
                    what we can to help turn the tide of obesity and unhealthiness in the world. To this end, we'd like to start a presence in 
                    schools in the next few years, to teach the adults of tomorrow the importance of taking care of yourself and that it isn't as 
                    difficult to do so as they are probably led to believe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Culture is shaped by fashion. It's about time we made healthy living fashionable again.
