                <p>
                    ...other than that, though, it's our passion for all things fitness that we believe gives us the edge over our
                    competition. It's not just the spirit of the company that bleeds a love of fitness, it's also within our staff.
                    No, seriously. Every blog post you see on this site is written by someone whose passion for athleticism and
                    self-improvement is limitless - it's actually a prerequisite to work for us.

                            Ouch. That one was right in the feels. The truth is that, no, we're actually
                            not. What you see on this site is the commercial side of <span class="brand-text-red" style="font-size: 16px">HERCULEAN</span>,
                            which includes our products and the news items we post for the community. However, we also work with a lot of gyms
                            worldwide, providing personal trainers and industry experts, to reach out and garner a greater interest in fitness
                            and gym culture mentality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our work has led to sponsorships at some of the best bodybuilding tournaments in the world, as well as the personal
                            sponsorship of some of the talented folks who provide the face of the fitness industry today. Our mantra has always
                            been about making you the best version of yourself you can be, and that goes above and beyond just a simple
                            supplement store.

                <h3>What are our goals for the future?</h3>
                <p>
                    The most dreaded interview question of all time. For us, though, it's a doozie because we have big plans ahead
                    and we just love to talk about them. Primarily, we'd like to expand the commercial side of the business to achieve
                    a greater global reach. We believe we have the quality of products to back that ambition up, as many of our regular
                    customers have attested over the last few years. Aside from that, we have plans to open a physical store in the heart
                    of London, with the hope of expanding to other major cities around the world. A lot of people talk about the death
                    of the high street these days, but we know the value in the unique and unbeatable experience of actually holding
                    what you're interested in purchasing in your own hands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from the commercial aspect, <span class="">HERCULEAN</span> has
                    the ability to help shape the future of the fitness world for years to come. We don't want to stop at just a gym
                    presence. We believe, especially in the current climate, that we have an obligation to do what we can to help turn the
                    tide of obesity and unhealthiness in the world. To this end, we'd like to start a presence in schools in the new few
                    years, to teach the adults of tomorrow the importance of taking care of yourself and that it isn't as difficult to
                    do so as they are probably led to believe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Culture is shaped by fashion. It's about time we made healthy living fashionable again.
